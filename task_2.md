The output is invalid due to wrong arguments passed to the `range` function. Lists in python are indexed from `0`, here we start from `1`, so the first element will never be printed. As a sidenote indexing is not a "pythonic" way to do this operation. The proper way to do this would be with `enumerate`:

```py
def print_list(a_list):
    for i, x in enumerate(a_list, start=1):
        print(f'Element {i} = {x}')

a_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print_list(a_list)
```
